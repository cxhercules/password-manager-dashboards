Over the past two decades, research about the use of password managers has grown.  We are still researching which type of passwords managers do technical and non-technical users prefer? --insert Karole et al.--

We have also discovered that usability issues on a password manager can lead to security exposures, Chiasson and Oorschot --insert reference--,  “users failing to properly activate the respective mechanisms (e.g., failing to enter @@ or double-click the web site password field). For both password managers, when users enter their password but forget to invoke the mechanism, the (raw) password is sent on as if the manager software was not installed, naturally exposing it to JavaScript and phishing attacks --insert reference--”
