Over the past two decades, research about the use of password managers has grown.  We are still researching which type of passwords managers do technical and non-technical users prefer? --insert Karole et al.--

We have also discovered that usability issues on a password manager can lead to security exposures, Chiasson and Oorschot --insert reference--,  “users failing to properly activate the respective mechanisms (e.g., failing to enter @@ or double-click the web site password field). For both password managers, when users enter their password but forget to invoke the mechanism, the (raw) password is sent on as if the manager software was not installed, naturally exposing it to JavaScript and phishing attacks --insert reference--”

Choosing a secure password
Previously, the study (*** reference ***) found that a user is likely to choose a memoizable password over a secure password. It is likely that a user underestimates the benefits of adding complexity (e.g. digits) into passwords and underestimates the threat of reusing the same password for different accounts.

Why we use password manager? Convenience is the major consideration for using a built-in password manager and the auto-fill function that offered by most password managers.
Some users emphasized their need of recalling their passwords instead of allowing the password manager to generate and store it. 
The research identified that built-in password manager leads to a poorer user password practice as compared to the third-party password managers.

The study found that password managers indeed influent password security.
Google Chrome’s auto-fill option aggravated the password reuse problem.
