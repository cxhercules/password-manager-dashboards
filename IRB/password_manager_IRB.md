## Expedited Paragraphs
**Request for Expedited Review**
An expedited review procedure consists of a review of research involving human subjects by the IRB Chair, or
by one or more experienced reviewers designated by the Chairperson from among the members of the
committees.
In order to be eligible for expedited review, ALL aspects of the research must include activities that (1) present
no more than minimal risk to human subjects, and (2) involve only procedures included in one or more of the
specific categories listed below.
If requesting Expedited Review, select one or more of the applicable paragraph(s) below.
(DO NOT select any paragraph(s) if your protocol does not qualify for expedited review. Protocols that do not
qualify for expedited review will be reviewed by the full (convened) Committee.)
1. Clinical studies of drugs and medical devices only when conditions (a) and (b) are met.
a) Research on drugs for which an investigational new drug application (21 CFR Part 312) is not
required. (Note: Research on marketed drugs that significantly increases the risks or decreases
the acceptability of the risks associated with the use of the product is not eligible for expedited
review.)
b) Research on medical devices for which
i) an investigational device exemption application (21 CFR Part 812) is not required; or
ii) the medical device is cleared/approved for marketing and the medical device is being used in
accordance with its cleared/approved labeling.

2. Collection of blood samples by finger stick, heel stick, ear stick, or venipuncture as follows:
a) From healthy, non-pregnant adults who weigh at least 110 pounds. For these subjects, the
amounts drawn may not exceed 550 ml in an 8 week period and collection may not occur more
frequently than 2 times per week; or
b) From other adults and children, considering the age, weight, and health of the subjects, the
collection procedure, the amount of blood to be collected, and the frequency with which it will be collected. For these subjects, the amount drawn may not exceed the lesser of 50 ml or 3 ml per kg in an 8 week period and collection may not occur more frequently than 2 times per week.

3. Prospective collection of biological specimen for research purposes by non-invasive means.

Are password managers actually increasing password hygiene?

1. Purpose of the study


a)Provide a brief explanation of the proposed research, including specific study hypothesis, objectives, and rationale.

Password managers liberate users from the impossible task of creating and remembering passwords.
Once marketed as a convenience, they now purport to improve users' security by replacing users' weak memorable passwords with strong-randomly generated ones.
Whereas user-chosen passwords may be predictable, random passwords generated by a password manager or not. Users can only remember a limited number of passwords, and when they re-use them, a password breach on one site may lead to the breach of their accounts on other sites. Passwords generated by password managers are unique for each site and are thus unaffected by breaches of other sites.

If users are not replacing their old passwords with random ones, and are not using opting for random passwords when creating new accounts, then they're not actually receiving the security benefits they may be expecting.  Are password managers actually increasing password hygiene? 

Password managers do not collect information that would allow them, or anyone else, to know if users are actually obtaining security benefits. To find out, we must reach out to users of password managers and ask.

Our approach is to recruit participants from the members of the general public who use passwords managers for and to ask them to report anonymized statistics generated by their password manager's "dashboard": the number of their passwords that are weak, re-used, or known to be compromised..

In our pilot study conducted for MICS W215, we found that most participants reported that they do not allow their password managers generate passwords for new accounts, as they wanted to use passwords they might remember in the absence of their password manager. We learned that users had an average of 43% of weak passwords and 55% of re-used passwords.

By revising the study and reaching out to a larger population, our research could potentially trigger the research community and industry to re-evaluate the current impact password managers on users' password hygiene and to explore new ways to improve hygiene, such as by through education, choice architecture, and improved user experience.


2. Background

a)Give relevant background (e.g., summarize previous/current related studies) on condition, procedure, product, etc. under investigation, includ

Prior security research focused on password managers examines such topics as whether the password managers are themselves the source of security vulnerabilities and what barriers inhibit users from adopting them.

More similar to our study is "Why people (don’t) use password managers effectively” (https://www.usenix.org/system/files/soups2019-pearman.pdf). This study showed how qualitative study of a group of password manager users were not using their passwords managers effectively. They observed similar concerns to those found in our pilot, but since it was an interview study it did more to identify problematic behaviors and less to quantify them.

This research was originally a final course project for W215 Usable Privacy and Security.  Team members include Christian Hercules, Jacky Ho and David Ng and our principal investigators are Stuart Schechter and Cristian Bravo-Lillo.  We are motivated to continue this research project that requires more test results so that we can further analyze user behavior on password manager applications.  We aim at conducting additional surveys on Amazon Mechanical Turk or Prolific.  Once we have gathered close to 1000 survey results we will analyze our data and produce a final research paper with our findings.

4. Study Procedures

a)Describe in chronological order of events how the research will be conducted, providing information about all study procedures and who will conduct each (e.g., how participants are identified, the consent process, interventions/interactions with subjects, data collection), including follow-up procedures. If any interviews, questionnaires, surveys, or focus groups will be conducted for the study, explain and attach one copy each of all study instruments (standard and/or non-standard) in the Attachments section. Please see eProtocol Attachments Check List for Exempt Applications for more information. Indicate frequency and duration of visits/sessions, as well as total time commitment for participants in the study and an estimated time frame for when the study will be completed. If the proposed research involves secondary use of data/specimens, describe how data/specimens will be acquired.

Methodology:

We will an online survey building on that of our pilot study.

As part of the survey, we will ask users to take a screenshot of the "dashboard" within their password manager that displays the total number of passwords stored, the number that the password managers considers "weak", the number that are re-used between sites, and the number that are known to have been compromised in breaches.  If users have replaced their existing passwords with random passwords generated by their password manager, the number of weak and re-used passwords should both be zero.

While the images should not contain any personally identifiable information, we will provide instructions to users on how to remove any information they don't wish to share.  Participants will be compensated even if they choose to filter out information that we require for our analysis.  We will not collect any passwords, user names, or personally-identifiable information from participants.

We will also ask users questions other questions about their password manager and their overall password hygiene, as well as demographic questions.

b)State if photographing, audio, or video recording will occur and for what purpose (e.g. transcription, coding facial expressions).

c)Alternatives to Participation
Describe appropriate alternative resources, procedures, courses of treatment, if any, that are available to prospective subjects. If there are no appropriate alternatives to study participation, this should be stated. If the study does not involve treatment/intervention, enter "N/A" here.

n/a

d) (Checkbox)
If the proposed research involves secondary use of data/specimens, check all that apply:

i) coded private information or specimens, and the investigator will not have access to the key.
ii) from publicly available sources.
iii) recorded by the investigator in such a manner that subjects cannot be identified OR any link to identifying information has been destroyed.


5. Subject Population
Describe proposed subject population, including criteria for study inclusion and exclusion (e.g., age, health status, language, gender, race, ethnicity). State the maximum number of subjects planned for the study. This number should account for all subjects to be recruited, including those who may drop out or be found ineligible.

1000 number of subjects is proposed in our study and our only pre-requisite for the subjects is they have used a password managers from our research list for at least 2 months or longer.

6. Risks and Discomforts

a)Describe all known risks and discomforts associated with study procedures, whether physical, psychological, economic, or social (e.g., pain, stress, invasion of privacy, breach of confidentiality), noting probability and magnitude of potential harm.

We are conducting a survey that sheds light on how diligent the participants have been with their security. Like any such survey, it could potentially make participants uncomfortable if they feel they are underperforming their peers or failing to be diligent. However, this discomfort seems a small risk compared to the social benefit of revealing how few users actually live up to standard of diligence. Further, participating in the study gives participants an opportunity to discover and consider actions that may improve their security. In our pilot studies under the classroom exemption, we did not receive any reports of participant discomfort.

b)If conducting educational tests, survey procedures, interview procedures, or observation of public behavior, AND linking to subjects' identifying information, explain why inadvertent release of the data would not have detrimental consequences (i.e. place subjects at risk of civil or criminal liability, or cause damage to their financial standing, employability or reputation).

n/a

c) In case of international research, describe the expertise you have, or have access to, which prepares you to conduct research in this location and/or with this subject population, including specific qualifications (e.g., relevant coursework, background, experience, and training). Also, explain your knowledge of local community attitudes and cultural norms, and cultural sensitivities necessary to carry out the research. See CPHS Guidelines on Research in an International Setting.

n/a

7. Confidentiality
a)Will data be collected anonymously (i.e., no identifying information from subjects will be collected/ recorded that can be linked to the study data)? If no, please list all identifiable and/or coded data elements to be collected. Data is not anonymous if there is a code linking it to personally identifiable information. Also, audio and video recordings are generally not considered anonymous unless distinguishing features can be successfully masked.

We do not intend to collect any data that would allow us to link survey responses to the individual respondent. We have carefully designed the study to ensure we collect the minimal amount of information needed to evaluate participants’ security behaviors and create an aggregate picture.
We are collecting the data using the Qualtrics survey system, which is the recommended tool at UC Berkeley because it offers privacy guarantees that other systems do not.

(b)Explain how data, audiotapes, videotapes and photographs, etc. will be secured (e.g., password-protected computer, encrypted files, locked cabinet)stored and who will have access to them. Indicate at what point they will be transcribed and/or destroyed (if ever).
