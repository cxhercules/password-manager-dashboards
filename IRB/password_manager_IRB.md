An expedited review procedure consists of a review of research involving human subjects by the IRB Chair, or
by one or more experienced reviewers designated by the Chairperson from among the members of the
committees.
In order to be eligible for expedited review, ALL aspects of the research must include activities that (1) present
no more than minimal risk to human subjects, and (2) involve only procedures included in one or more of the
specific categories listed below.
If requesting Expedited Review, select one or more of the applicable paragraph(s) below.
(DO NOT select any paragraph(s) if your protocol does not qualify for expedited review. Protocols that do not
qualify for expedited review will be reviewed by the full (convened) Committee.)
1. Clinical studies of drugs and medical devices only when conditions (a) and (b) are met.
a) Research on drugs for which an investigational new drug application (21 CFR Part 312) is not
required. (Note: Research on marketed drugs that significantly increases the risks or decreases
the acceptability of the risks associated with the use of the product is not eligible for expedited
review.)
b) Research on medical devices for which
i) an investigational device exemption application (21 CFR Part 812) is not required; or
ii) the medical device is cleared/approved for marketing and the medical device is being used in
accordance with its cleared/approved labeling.

Are Password Managers being used correctly?

1. Purpose of the study


a)Provide a brief explanation of the proposed research, including specific study hypothesis, objectives, and rationale.

Password managers liberate users from the impossible task of creating and remembering a long unique password for every site and service they use. Password managers can increase users’ security by replacing their weak and re-used passwords with long random unique ones. Once recommended as a convenience, they are now sold under the premise that they improve users’ password security. The security benefits presupposes that users let the password manager choose long, random, unique passwords for them. It presupposes that users will take the steps required to replace their old weak passwords with passwords chosen by their password manager. If users fail to do so, they will not get many of those promised security benefits.
Do users choose passwords generated by their password manager asked to create a new password, and are they replacing their old passwords with passwords generated by their password manager?  Password managers do not collect information that would allow them, or anyone else, to know if users are actually obtaining security benefits. To find out, we must reach out to users of password managers and ask.
In our pilot study conducted as part of MICS W215, we found that most users would not even let password managers generate passwords for new accounts, as they wanted to use passwords they might remember in the absence of their password manager. We learned that users had an average of 43% of weak passwords and 55% of re-used passwords.
We believe that password managers are not currently designed to incentivize users to follow best practices such as eliminate weak and reused passwords. The current indicators and dashboards on password managers are not effective in lowering the amount of weak passwords and use of reused passwords. Our research will gather information from the general public who have used passwords managers for more than 2 months and have these security indicators that displays the total number of weak and reused password.

This study is valuable because the companies that make password managers prioritize a posture of never looking at any of their customers' data over collecting aggregate statistics that would let them know if their products are actually being used in a way that protects users.  Thus, the companies that make password managers can't know if their efforts to convince users to be more secure are working -- and it appears they are not.  Companies who are designing password managers should be interested in this  research, as it may help shape how password managers are designed for users who are still reluctant to use them.

2. Background

a)Give relevant background (e.g., summarize previous/current related studies) on condition, procedure, product, etc. under investigation, including citations (with attached bibliography) if applicable.
Part of the inspiration for our work into password managers is Lorrie Cranor’s work. In particular, "Why people (don’t) use password managers effectively”. This study showed how qualitative study of a group of password manager users were not using their passwords managers effectively. In essence, they kept the same passwords on different accounts, they used weak passwords, and they did not update their passwords on a regular basis. We chatted briefly with her, and she gave us guidance that a quantitative study would be interesting, and so we set out to discover what we would learn. We read the article titled “Before You Use a Password Manager” by Stuart Schechter where we learned what users should consider when choosing a password manager.  A consumer has many passwords managers to choose from, where features and functionalities can range from generating passwords for the user to identifying reused or weak passwords.  In “Before You Use a Password Manager” Schechter illustrates the functionalities of popular password managers in the market.

This research was originally a final course project for W215 Usable Privacy and Security.  Team members include Christian Hercules, Jacky Ho and David Ng and our principal investigators are Stuart Schechter and Cristian Bravo-Lillo.  We are motivated to continue this research project that requires more test results so that we can further analyze user behavior on password manager applications.  We aim at conducting additional surveys on Amazon Mechanical Turk or Prolific.  Once we have gathered close to 1000 survey results we will analyze our data and produce a final research paper with our findings.

4. Study Procedures

a)Describe in chronological order of events how the research will be conducted, providing information about all study procedures and who will conduct each (e.g., how participants are identified, the consent process, interventions/interactions with subjects, data collection), including follow-up procedures. If any interviews, questionnaires, surveys, or focus groups will be conducted for the study, explain and attach one copy each of all study instruments (standard and/or non-standard) in the Attachments section. Please see eProtocol Attachments Check List for Exempt Applications for more information. Indicate frequency and duration of visits/sessions, as well as total time commitment for participants in the study and an estimated time frame for when the study will be completed. If the proposed research involves secondary use of data/specimens, describe how data/specimens will be acquired.

Methodology:

We conducted an online survey to find out what password managers are using, when do they utilize password managers, how many passwords are inside their password managers and how do they react to the information provided by password managers related to their passwords.

Selection of Password Manager
To evaluate the user habits toward reused and weak passwords, we studied a list of password managers that are available in the market. We reviewed each of the password managers to evaluate whether it provides information on reused passwords and weak passwords through its security dashboard. Table 2 provides an overview of the review result. We selected the password managers for our study when and only when users are able to find out the total number of passwords managed by the password manager, the number of reused passwords, and the number of weak passwords identified by the password manager.

Recruitment of candidates
We recruited candidates from Mechanical Turk (MTurk), the eligible candidates must be currently using one of the mainstream password managers.  Using one of the shortlisted password manager (Desktop and Web version) for at least 2 months

Conducting the survey
We targeted to recruit 100 participants from MTurk in from July 2020 to August 2020, we explained to them that we were conducting usability research on a selected set of password managers and would like them to provide a screenshot showing that they are currently using the password manager and to answer a few questions about the information presented on the security dashboard of their password managers. As part of phase 1, we also asked them to provide their demographic and password manager usage experience information.

As a precaution, we reminded them to mask their password and other personal information such as their account name if the security dashboard is showing them. We included the step of masking such information in our step by step guide for taking the screenshot.

b)State if photographing, audio, or video recording will occur and for what purpose (e.g. transcription, coding facial expressions).

n/a

c)Alternatives to Participation
Describe appropriate alternative resources, procedures, courses of treatment, if any, that are available to prospective subjects. If there are no appropriate alternatives to study participation, this should be stated. If the study does not involve treatment/intervention, enter "N/A" here.

n/a

d) (Checkbox)
If the proposed research involves secondary use of data/specimens, check all that apply:

i) coded private information or specimens, and the investigator will not have access to the key.
ii) from publicly available sources.
iii) recorded by the investigator in such a manner that subjects cannot be identified OR any link to identifying information has been destroyed.


5. Subject Population
Describe proposed subject population, including criteria for study inclusion and exclusion (e.g., age, health status, language, gender, race, ethnicity). State the maximum number of subjects planned for the study. This number should account for all subjects to be recruited, including those who may drop out or be found ineligible.

1000 number of subjects is proposed in our study and our only pre-requisite for the subjects is they have used a password managers from our research list for at least 2 months or longer.

6. Risks and Discomforts

a)Describe all known risks and discomforts associated with study procedures, whether physical, psychological, economic, or social (e.g., pain, stress, invasion of privacy, breach of confidentiality), noting probability and magnitude of potential harm.

We are conducting a survey that sheds light on how diligent the participants have been with their security. Like any such survey, it could potentially make participants uncomfortable if they feel they are underperforming their peers or failing to be diligent. However, this discomfort seems a small risk compared to the social benefit of revealing how few users actually live up to standard of diligence. Further, participating in the study gives participants an opportunity to discover and consider actions that may improve their security. In our pilot studies under the classroom exemption, we did not receive any reports of participant discomfort.

b)If conducting educational tests, survey procedures, interview procedures, or observation of public behavior, AND linking to subjects' identifying information, explain why inadvertent release of the data would not have detrimental consequences (i.e. place subjects at risk of civil or criminal liability, or cause damage to their financial standing, employability or reputation).

n/a

c) In case of international research, describe the expertise you have, or have access to, which prepares you to conduct research in this location and/or with this subject population, including specific qualifications (e.g., relevant coursework, background, experience, and training). Also, explain your knowledge of local community attitudes and cultural norms, and cultural sensitivities necessary to carry out the research. See CPHS Guidelines on Research in an International Setting.

n/a

7. Confidentiality
a)Will data be collected anonymously (i.e., no identifying information from subjects will be collected/ recorded that can be linked to the study data)? If no, please list all identifiable and/or coded data elements to be collected. Data is not anonymous if there is a code linking it to personally identifiable information. Also, audio and video recordings are generally not considered anonymous unless distinguishing features can be successfully masked.

We do not intend to collect any data that would allow us to link survey responses to the individual respondent. We have carefully designed the study to ensure we collect the minimal amount of information needed to evaluatie participants’ security behaviors and create an aggregate picture.
We are collecting the data using the Qualtrics survey system, which is the recommended tool at UC Berkeley because it offers privacy guarantees that other systems do not.

(b)Explain how data, audiotapes, videotapes and photographs, etc. will be secured (e.g., password-protected computer, encrypted files, locked cabinet)stored and who will have access to them. Indicate at what point they will be transcribed and/or destroyed (if ever).
