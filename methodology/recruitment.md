## Recruitment

We recruited for our study using Prolific, which provides features similar to Mechanical Turk but is designed specifically for researchers and research participants.

We advertised a two-question study on Prolific under the title ``Do You Use a Password Manager and, if so, Which One?''.

> This is a two-question multiple-choice survey. (One multiple choice question has an “other” that may require 2-3 words.)

> It should take under two minutes, though we may offer additional information for you may voluntarily read after that you can choose to spend more time reading.

> It asks whether you use a password manager and, if so, for how long.

We used an option provided by prolific to filter out participants who were not using the service from a desktop computer, and therefore would be less likely to be able to access their password manager's desktop/web interface.

We [used | did not use] the option Prolific offers for "representative sampling."

We set the expected completion time of 1 minute and offered a payment of  GBP 0.20.
**NOTE: there is an inconsistency between the 2-minutes in our written description and the one minute in our study configuration in prolific.**

We first asked participants:

> Which password manager are you using for your personal accounts? (if you use more than one, please report the one that manages the most accounts.)

We first listed options for third-party password managers, sorted alphabetically: 1Password, Bitwarden (Premium Edition), Bitwarden (Free Edition), Dashlane, KeePassXC, Keeper Password Manager, LastPass, Norton Password Manager, Password Boss, RoboForm, and StickyPassword.
We then listed browser password managers sorted alphabetically by software company: Apple, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla.
We then asked about other browser or third-party password managers, with a text field for the respondent to fill in.
Lastly, we offered the option to respond ``I'm not using a password manager".

Our first qualification test was whether participants had responded with one of the listed third-party password managers or with Google Chrome, which also offers a dashboard from which we could collect password statistics.  
In our pilots, we found that the password manager built into Google's Chrome browser was the most widely used.  To balance participation rates, we down-sampled participants using Chrome's password manager by randomly excluding 14 out of 15 from the first qualification test (using a random number generator).

For those participants failed the first qualification test, including 14 of the 15 participants who used Chrome's password manager, we used the second of the two questions we had contracted for to ask:

> *??Nothing??*

We then thanked the participants who didn't meet our first qualification criteria for successfully participating in then study, without revealing that the the questions were intended to determine qualification for our full study.

**Stuart recalls that we were asking them something. Are we wasting our second question? In qualtrics it looks like we're just ending after the first question.**

For those who passed the first qualification test, we asked:

> How long have you been using a password manager?

> This includes other password managers that you have used before.

**Stuart asks: wait?  did we just add the bit about including password manager you have used before?  Don't we want to know that they've been using the current password manager for at least two months?**

We categorized the participants who responded "Less than 2 months" as having failed the second qualification test. We thanked them for successfully participating in the two-question study, without revealing that the two questions were intended to determine qualification for our full study.

The remaining participants qualified for our full study, but had only agreed to complete a two-question study.  We were obligated to pay them without burdening them with additional questions.

**Stuart asks: we could have described this as a three-question study with the same amount of time and avoided an ethical issue here.  I think we should!**
