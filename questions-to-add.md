Condition: self-reported re-used passwords > 0

Your indicated that your dashboard reported you have re-used passwords.

- I have used the dashboard to ensure that I never re-use passwords for accounts that I wouldn't want compromised, but may still be re-using passwords for low-value accounts.
- I have used the dashboard to replace some re-used passwords, but am not sure I am not re-using passwords for accounts that I would not want compromised.
- I have seend the dashboard, but I have not looked at the list of re-used passwords because I'm already confident that I am not re-using passwords for accounts that I would not want compromised.
- I have seen the dashboard but haven't gotten around to taking action about re-used passwords.
- I was aware that the dashboard exists before this study, but I hadn't seen it or hadn't noticed that I have been re-using passwords.
- I was unaware that the dashboard exists before this study.


We could use the same style of question for weak passwords and compromised passwords.

Or, we chould do staged questions:

 - Have you seen the dashboard before?  (applies to re-used, weak, and compromised)
 - Were you previously aware that you had re-used passwords?
 - Have you used your password manager to replace some of your previously re-used passwords?
 - Are you confident that the only accounts for which you are still re-using passwords are low-value accounts that you would not care about being compromised?
