## Context of the study
One major problem today is that Internet users are able to remember fewer passwords than the amount of authenticated websites or apps they visit. One possible solution is provided by password managers - most (if not all) major brands offer the possibility of generating unique, random passwords for every authenticated website that a user visits. Password managers offer also other benefits, such as entering passwords automatically in authenticated websites, and doing it based only on websites' URLs, which provides some protection against phishing.

However, since vendors have incentives to not look at users' data, we don't know whether people are using password managers to either generate random passwords or to store their manually created passwords instead. One way to know this is by looking at how many passwords are classified as "weak" or "repeated" by password managers.



## Purpose of the study

Our main goal is to determine how are people using password managers. In particular, for a set of 10 third-party password managers (1Password, Bitwarden Premium Edition, Dashlane, KeePassXC, Keeper Password Manager, Lastpass, Norton Password Manager, Password Boss, Roboform and StickyPassword), we are interested in knowing:

1. How many passwords in total does each person store in their password manager (Q1),
2. How many passwords are marked as reused, weak or compromised by password managers (Q2),
3. Whether people are more likely to create a password themselves and let the password manager store it, or whether they would let their password manager create a random password instead when creating an account on a website (Q3),
4. Whether people feel it's okay to have either reused, weak or compromised passwords (Q4),
5. How do people report to create their master password (Q5),
6. Whether people recall receiving notifications from their password managers urging them to change repeated, weak or compromised passwords (Q6).
7. How long has the person used passwords managers (Q7).

To do this, we plan to run a survey through Prolific (https://www.prolific.co/). To those subjects that claim to use one of the password managers we are interested in, we will ask to upload a picture of the dashboard provided by their password manager, masking those areas of the image that may contain private information. Responses are anonymous, and we are not asking for any private information to our subjects. Our study was approved by the IRB at the University of California, Berkeley.



## Methodology

We will observe and report:

1. The proportion of reused/weak/compromised passwords that users maintain (i.e., Q2 over Q1),
2. The proportion of subjects who assert that they would rather create a password themselves instead of creating a random password (Q3),
3. What reasons people report to maintain reused/weak/compromised passwords (Q4 and related questions),
4. How do people report creating their master password, and whether they have taken precautions to not lose access to it (Q5 and related questions),
5. The proportion of subjects who recall having received a notification to change their reused/weak passwords (Q6).

In addition, we'll run the following tests:

1. A logistic regression with subjects' age and gender as input, and Q3 as output. The purpose is to verify if age or gender have an effect on subjects' willingness to allow password managers to create random passwords for them. We expect that since older users trust less on technology, they are less likely to let a password manager create a random password for them.
2. A linear regression with age, gender, and how long have the person used  as input, and the proportion of weak/reused passwords out of the total number of stored passwords as output. The purpose is to verify whether age, gender or experience with password managers have any effects on how many weak/reused passwords does the user maintain.
